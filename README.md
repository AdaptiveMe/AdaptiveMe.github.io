## What is Adaptive.me?
Adaptive is a multi-platform, multi-screen app development and build environment that provides the right tools crafted for and by developers, designers and testers like you. We strive to build a better way to create HTML5 hybrid apps for mobile, web and everywhere. 

Adaptive is comprised of a series of PaaS (Platform-As-A-Service) development tools and build services and open-source runtimes to encapsulate hybrid apps on a diversity of platforms. The Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) represents all the open-source portions of the platform to facilitate co-creation, contribution and build a community around our project!

For more information please visit <http://adaptive.me>. And, yes, we need to make some money at some stage to feed our developers and pet hamsters - yours truly included - all donations of funds and materials for the development and support of these open-source projects are very welcome. Codingly yours, [Carlos](https://github.com/carloslozano)!
