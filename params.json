{"name":"Adaptive.Me","tagline":"Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) Site","body":"## Welcome to the Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) Project\r\nThis is the AdaptiveMe Runtime Platform project site, here you will find general information about Adaptive, the organisation of the project and its subprojects, how to contribute and how to communicate with other contributors and committers of the project. This project is curated by @carloslozano. Welcome!\r\n\r\n### What is Adaptive?\r\nAdaptive is a multi-platform, multi-screen app development and build environment that provides the right tools crafted for and by developers, designers and testers like you. We strive to build a better way to create HTML5 hybrid apps for mobile, web and everywhere. \r\n\r\nAdaptive is comprised of a series of PaaS (Platform-As-A-Service) development tools and build services and open-source runtimes to encapsulate hybrid apps on a diversity of platforms. The Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) represents all the open-source portions of the platform to facilitate co-creation, contribution and build a community around our project!\r\n\r\nFor more information please visit <http://adaptive.me>. And, yes, we need to make some money at some stage to feed our developers and pet hamsters - yours truly included - all donations of funds and materials for the development and support of these open-source projects are very welcome. Codingly yours, @carloslozano. \r\n\r\n### What is Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP)?\r\nHybrid apps are applications that are build using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript web technologies that use a native “container” to present the content to a user and to access – bridging web and native contexts - the native functionalities of the device for which the application is built. \r\n\r\nThe Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) provides these native “containers” for the main mobile and desktop platforms so that Hybrid apps can be compiled and deployed on a multiplicity of devices leveraging the same code developed using modern web technologies. Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) and sub-projects are open-source under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n\r\n## Administrative Organisation\r\nThis project is curated by Carlos Lozano Diez (@carloslozano). For administrative matters;  contributor license agreements (CLA) and/or questions, please send a mail to [carlos@adaptive.me](carlos@adaptive.me). \r\n\r\n### Ideas, Suggestions and Requirements\r\nIf you have any ideas, suggestions or requirements that affect the whole Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP), please open an issue [here](https://github.com/AdaptiveMe/AdaptiveMe.github.io/issues). We welcome any contributions to make the Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) better:\r\n\r\n* Ideas - things that would be really cool to add to the platform.\r\n* Suggestions - better methods, tools, etc. that make everyone's life easier.\r\n* Requirements - cool stuff you'd like to see appear in the platform; additional APIs, features, etc.\r\n\r\nSubmit your ideas/suggestions/requirements [here](https://github.com/AdaptiveMe/AdaptiveMe.github.io/issues).\r\n\r\n### Project Organisation\r\n\r\n![Project Packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdaptiveMe/AdaptiveMe.github.io/master/images/project-packages.png)\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nWe'd *love to accept your patches and contributions to this project*.  There are a just a few small guidelines you need to follow to ensure that you and/or your company and our project are safeguarded from inadvertent copyright infringement. I know, this can be a pain but we want fairplay from the very start so that we're all on the same page.\r\n\r\n#### Contributor License Agreement\r\n\r\nContributions to any Adaptive project are subject to the [Apache Public License v2.0][] and Adaptive as project curators require that you provide a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  This is **not** a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives the Adaptive permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.\r\n\r\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA][].\r\n\r\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work on their behalf, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][].\r\n\r\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one for any of the Adaptive projects then you probably don't need to do it again.\r\n\r\n[individual CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual\r\n[corporate CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate\r\n[Apache Public License v2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Submitting a patch\r\n\r\n  1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to fix or add.  Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be assigned to you.\r\n\r\n  1. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new\r\n     branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in\r\n     separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the\r\n     commits related to that bug or feature.\r\n\r\n  1. Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  We aim to have a good test coverage, so look at some of the existing tests if you're unsure how to go about it. If the project has no tests, feel free to contribute them. Tests are contributions too!\r\n\r\n  1. Do your best to have well-formed commit messages for each change. If you're closing an issue with the commit, include the words \"Fixes #<issuenumber>\" in your comment where <issuenumber> is the number of the issue or feature being fixed or added. This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools and that issues are automatically closed by github.\r\n\r\n  1. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][].\r\n  \r\n[forking]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\r\n[pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request\r\n\r\n#### Becoming a Contributor\r\n\r\nAnyone can become a contributor by the project - you become a contributor when any of your submitted functionality of fixes are accepted after your [pull request][]. \r\n\r\nEnsure that you've provided us with a Contributor License Agreement if you're submitting significant changes or new functionality. Minor changes may be accepted without a CLA at the discretion of existing project committers.\r\n\r\n#### Becoming a Committer\r\n\r\nConsistent and regular contributors can apply to become a Committer by being nominated by an existing committer of the project. You start by becoming a Contributor and graduate to Committer after demonstrating your commitment to the development and continued evolution of the project. Committers become Contributors after a vote by existing Committers of the project.\r\n\r\n#### Governance\r\n\r\nThis project is curated by [Carlos Lozano][] and [Adaptive.me]. Committers to the project have the right to accept pull requests from contributors. Contributions that do not adhere to the positive karma and spirit of the project may be rejected. Objections may be raised to the curator of the project (@carloslozano) using the issue tracker for the project in question. \r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Carlos Lozano Diez.\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Adaptive.me.\r\nLicensed under Apache Public License v2.0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Carlos Lozano]: https://github.com/carloslozano\r\n[Adaptive.me]: https://github.com/AdaptiveMe\r\n\r\n### Support and Contact\r\n\r\n***Adaptive General Q&A***\r\n\r\n* **Forum:** <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adaptive-general>\r\n* **Mailing list:** <mailto:adaptive-general@googlegroups.com>\r\n\r\n***Adaptive API Discussion***\r\n\r\nFor matters pertaining to the cross-platform APIs (interfaces and common code), please use the following communication channels.\r\n\r\n* **Forum:** <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adaptive-api>\r\n* **Mailing list:** <mailto:adaptive-api@googlegroups.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n***Adaptive Implementation Discussion***\r\n\r\nFor matters pertaining to platform specific implementation of the APIs.\r\n\r\n* **Forum:** <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adaptive-impl>\r\n* **Mailing list:** <mailto:adaptive-impl@googlegroups.com>\r\n\r\n***Adaptive Runtime Discussion***\r\n\r\nFor matters pertaining to platform specific build and runtime topics.\r\n\r\n* **Forum:** <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adaptive-runtime>\r\n* **Mailing list:** <mailto:adaptive-runtime@googlegroups.com>\r\n\r\n***Adaptive Official***\r\n\r\n* **Site:** <http://adaptive.me>\r\n* **Blog:** <http://adaptive.me/blog>\r\n* **Twitter:** <https://twitter.com/adaptiveme>\r\n\r\n### License\r\nAll the source code of the Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP), including all sub-projects curated by @carloslozano, are distributed, and must be contributed, under the terms of the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
