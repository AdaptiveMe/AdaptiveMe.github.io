<p>This is the AdaptiveMe Runtime Platform project site, here you will find general information about Adaptive, the organisation of the project and its subprojects, how to contribute and how to communicate with other contributors and committers of the project. This project is curated by <a href="https://github.com/carloslozano" class="user-mention">@carloslozano</a>. Welcome!</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-is-adaptive" class="anchor" href="#what-is-adaptive"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Adaptive?</h3>

<p>Adaptive is a multi-platform, multi-screen app development and build environment that provides the right tools crafted for and by developers, designers and testers like you. We strive to build a better way to create HTML5 hybrid apps for mobile, web and everywhere. </p>

<p>Adaptive is comprised of a series of PaaS (Platform-As-A-Service) development tools and build services and open-source runtimes to encapsulate hybrid apps on a diversity of platforms. The Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) represents all the open-source portions of the platform to facilitate co-creation, contribution and build a community around our project!</p>

<p>For more information please visit <a href="http://adaptive.me">http://adaptive.me</a>. And, yes, we need to make some money at some stage to feed our developers and pet hamsters - yours truly included - all donations of funds and materials for the development and support of these open-source projects are very welcome. Codingly yours, <a href="https://github.com/carloslozano" class="user-mention">@carloslozano</a>. </p>

<h3>
<a name="what-is-adaptive-runtime-platform-arp" class="anchor" href="#what-is-adaptive-runtime-platform-arp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP)?</h3>

<p>Hybrid apps are applications that are build using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript web technologies that use a native “container” to present the content to a user and to access – bridging web and native contexts - the native functionalities of the device for which the application is built. </p>

<p>The Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) provides these native “containers” for the main mobile and desktop platforms so that Hybrid apps can be compiled and deployed on a multiplicity of devices leveraging the same code developed using modern web technologies. Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) and sub-projects are open-source under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.</p>

<a name="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>

<p>We'd <em>love to accept your patches and contributions to this project</em>.  There are a just a few small guidelines you need to follow to ensure that you and/or your company and our project are safeguarded from inadvertent copyright infringement. I know, this can be a pain but we want fairplay from the very start so that we're all on the same page.</p>

<h3>
<a name="contributor-license-agreement" class="anchor" href="#contributor-license-agreement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributor License Agreement</h3>

<p>Contributions to any Adaptive project are subject to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Public License v2.0</a> and Adaptive as project curators require that you provide a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  This is <strong>not</strong> a copyright <strong>assignment</strong>, it simply gives the Adaptive permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual">individual CLA</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work on their behalf, then you'll need to sign a <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate">corporate CLA</a>.</p></li>
</ul><p>You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one for any of the Adaptive projects then you probably don't need to do it again.</p>

<h3>
<a name="submitting-a-patch" class="anchor" href="#submitting-a-patch"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submitting a patch</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to fix or add.  Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be assigned to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the normal process of <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">forking</a> the project, and setup a new
 branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in
 separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the
 commits related to that bug or feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  We aim to have a good test coverage, so look at some of the existing tests if you're unsure how to go about it. If the project has no tests, feel free to contribute them. Tests are contributions too!</p></li>
<li><p>Do your best to have well-formed commit messages for each change. If you're closing an issue with the commit, include the words "Fixes #" in your comment where  is the number of the issue or feature being fixed or added. This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools and that issues are automatically closed by github.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>.</p></li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="becoming-a-contributor" class="anchor" href="#becoming-a-contributor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Becoming a Contributor</h3>

<p>Anyone can become a contributor by the project - you become a contributor when any of your submitted functionality of fixes are accepted after your <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>. </p>

<p>Ensure that you've provided us with a Contributor License Agreement if you're submitting significant changes or new functionality. Minor changes may be accepted without a CLA at the discretion of existing project committers.</p>

<h3>
<a name="becoming-a-committer" class="anchor" href="#becoming-a-committer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Becoming a Committer</h3>

<p>Consistent and regular contributors can apply to become a Committer by being nominated by an existing committer of the project. You start by becoming a Contributor and graduate to Committer after demonstrating your commitment to the development and continued evolution of the project. Committers become Contributors after a vote by existing Committers of the project.</p>

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
