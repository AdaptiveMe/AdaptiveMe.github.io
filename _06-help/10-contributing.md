## Contributing Ideas, Suggestions and Requirements

If you have any ideas, suggestions or requirements that affect the whole of Adaptive, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/AdaptiveMe/AdaptiveMe.github.io/issues).
We welcome any contributions to make Adaptive as good as humanly possible:

* _Ideas_ - things that would be really cool to add to the platform.
* _Suggestions_ - better methods, tools, etc. that make everyone's life easier.
* _Requirements_ - cool stuff you'd like to see appear in the platform; additional APIs, features, etc.

## Contributing Code

We'd _love_ to accept your patches and code contributions the project.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdaptiveMe) you'd like to contribute to.
2. Make your additions and changes.
3. Send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on GitHub.

Committers to the master project have the right to accept pull requests from contributors. Contributions that do not adhere to the positive karma and spirit of the project may be rejected - obviously.
To avoid legalese, and to summarise, if you send us any pull request it means you can and want to do so under the open source license of the project in question.

## Contributing Tutorials, Art, Videos, Samples, etc.

We _smaller than 3_ you!
